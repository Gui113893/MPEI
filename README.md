# PMCE - (Probabilistic Methods for Computer Engineering)

### Final Grade: 17/20

## Objective

To justify the need of probabilistic methods in the computer engineering context and to teach simulation tecniques of discrete events

## Content

* Calculate the probability of events in random experiments and also in sequences of Bernoulli experiments;
* Characterize random variables with known distributions (e.g. Binomial, Poissson, Uniform and Normal);
* Calculate parameters such as: mean, variance, correlation, covariance and correlation coefficient;
* Understand and describe the concept of stochastic process;
* Calculate auto-correlation and auto-covariance;
* Determine the state transition matrix of a Markov chain;
* Calculate the probabilities of the states, of a Markov chain, after n iterations;

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three types of folder:
- `PLX`: the folder with the exercise sheet nº`X`;
- `Exame_113893`: the folder that contains the exercises of the practical exame;
- `Teste0X`: the folder with the content of the exercises sheets that were evaluated.
